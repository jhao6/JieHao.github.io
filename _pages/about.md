I'm a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Mingrui Liu](https://mingrliu.github.io/) at [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/). Before that, I received my master's degree of compuer science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by [William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
