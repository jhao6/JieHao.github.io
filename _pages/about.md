I'm a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Mingrui Liu](https://mingrliu.github.io/) at [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/) since Spring 2023. Before that, I received my master's degree in compuer science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and bachlor's degree in EE from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). I focus on designing efficient machine learning algorithms for practical problmes, including continual learning, meta-learning and large language model, and provide theoretical guatantees.
