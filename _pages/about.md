I'm a Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/)ï¼Œadvised by Prof. [Mingrui Liu](https://mingrliu.github.io/) and Prof. [Jie Xu](https://mason.gmu.edu/~jxu13/). I received my master's degree in compuer science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and bachelor's degree in EE from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). I focus on designing efficient machine learning algorithms for practical problems, including data selection for pretraining/fine-tuning in LLM, continual learning, meta-learning, and provide theoretical guatantees. 

<font color=red>**I am currently looking for a research internship opportunity in 2026 summer related to large language model (LLM) training, optimization, or acceleration. Please feel free to contact me if there are any suitable opportunities, Thanks.**</font>

Projects
------

I'm participating in the project of [AUDITION](https://math-digital-twin.github.io/). This project aims to develop the mathematical foundations for a digital twin (DT) system for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), focusing on dynamic modeling, prediction, uncertainty quantification, and treatment or intervention recommendation through DT-based optimization.
